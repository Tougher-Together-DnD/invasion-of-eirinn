#### At Dungeon Master's Discretion:
I try to give you, the player, as much freedom and imagination when it comes to crafting an engaging character. However, for the sake of balance and preparation, discuss with me before doing the following:

* %%STUFF%% The player should consult with DM before using.
* %%BANNED%% Stuff like flying races or Unearthed Arcana banned from being used (Some DM's ban that).
  
#### House Rules:
* Drinking a Potion, recovering arrows, and other such things count as interacting with objects.
* Administering a potion to another player counts as an Action. Remind the DM when you're picking up arrows. Generally you can recover half the arrows shot, confirm number with DM.
* Summary of the biggest homebrew changes.

## Sessions
* We are all here to have fun. If something is bothering you, for any reason, please speak with me (the DM). I want to hear from you.
* Be courteous to other players by showing up on time.
* Include everyone in on the fun. We can accomplish this, by of course, the obligatory refraining from hate speech and abuse.
* This is an ***Adult Game***, but be considerate and respectful others in language and topics.
* Each session is %%SESSION-LENGTH%% hours.

## Payment
A payment of $%%AMOUNT%% is expected before the beginning of each weekly session.
Session 0 (zero) is free, as the players and DM get to know each other!

**Why should you pay?**  
Paying for games provides a distinct incentive for both the DM and players to consistently be on time and ready to play each session. It also helps offset the time and money the DM spends preparing for the sessions. I want to provide you the the best player experience I can.

**Disclaimer:**
*This game will require payment to the Game Master at a rate of $%%AMOUNT%% per session, paid 1 hours in advance via PayPal. Roll20 is not responsible for any payment transactions and cannot enforce any private arrangements.*
