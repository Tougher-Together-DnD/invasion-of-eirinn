## Fisher
You have spent your life aboard Fishing vessels or combing the shallows for the bounty of the ocean. Perhaps you were born into a Family of fisher folk, working with your kin to feed your Village. Maybe the job was a means to an end—a way out of an undesirable circumstance that forced you to take up life aboard a ship. Regardless of how you began, you soon fell in love with The Sea, the art of Fishing, and the promise of the eternal horizon.

**Skill Proficiencies:** History, Survival  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Vehicles (water)  
**Languages:** One of your choice  
**Equipment:** Fishing tackle, a net, a favorite Fishing lure or oiled leather wading boots, a set of traveler’s clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

<br>

## Feature: Harvest the Water
You gain advantage on Ability Checks made using Fishing tackle. If you have access to a body of water that sustains Marine life, you can maintain a moderate lifestyle while working as a fisher, and you can catch enough food to feed yourself and up to ten other people each day.

## Fishing Tale

You can tell a compelling tale, whether tall or true, to impress and entertain others. Once a day, you can tell your story to willing listeners. At the DM’s discretion, a number of those listeners become friendly toward you; this is not a magical Effect, and continued amicability on their part depends on your Actions. You can roll on the following table to help determine the theme of your tale or choose one that best fits your character. Alternatively, work with your DM to create your own Fishing tale.

**Nemesis Crab.** A large crab with a claw the size of your head claimed one of your eyes before jetting away; one day, you’ll find that clam.
