## Smuggler
On a rickety barge, you carried a hundred longswords in fish barrels right past the dock master’s oblivious lackeys. You have paddled a riverboat filled with stolen elven wine under the gaze of the moon and sold it for twice its value in the morning. In your more charitable times, you have transported innocents out of war zones or helped guide herd animals to safety on the banks of a burning river.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Deception  
**Tool Proficiencies:** Vehicles (water)  
**Equipment:** A fancy leather vest or a pair of leather boots, a set of Common clothes, and a leather pouch with 15 gp  

<br>

## Feature: Down Low
You are acquainted with a network of smugglers who are willing to help you out of tight situations. While in a particular town, city, or other similarly sized community (DM’s discretion), you and your companions can stay for free in safe houses. Safe houses provide a poor lifestyle. While staying at a Safe House, you can choose to keep your presence (and that of your companions) a Secret.

## Claim to Fame
Every smuggler has that one tale that sets them apart from Common criminals. By wits, sailing skill, or a Silver Tongue, you lived to tell the story—and you tell it often. You can roll on the following table to determine your claim or choose one that best fits your character.

**Playing Both Sides.** You once smuggled crates of Crossbow bolts and bundles of Arrows, each destined for an opposing side in a regional war, at the same time. The buyers arrived within moments of each other but did not discover your trickery.
